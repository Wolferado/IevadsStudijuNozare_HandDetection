# "Sign Language Detection and Display" Prototype

> [!WARNING]
> This project has been archived due to these reasons:
> - It has basic functionality that was necessary to develop during production time
> - No interest to develop it further in the current state

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains a Jupiter Notebook with created program _(prototype)_, that takes your Webcam Video as an input and scans it for static hand signs _(from the Latvian Sign Language)_.
>
> The goal of the program is to display needed sign based on the hand and fingers positions.

[MediaPipe Hands Solution API](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands) is used to track hands and make it available to detect hands and display necessary letters based on the hand landmarks.

### The table of available signs is available here _(only outlined signs are implemented)_:
