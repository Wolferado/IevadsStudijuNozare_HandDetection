# "Sign Language Detection and Display" Prototype

This repository contains a Jupiter Notebook with created program _(prototype)_, which takes your Webcam Video as an input and scans it for any hand signs _(currently only for the left hand)_.

Created program language is Python.

MediaPipe Hands Solution API is used to track hands and make it available to detect hands and display necessary letters based on the hand landmarks.

API: _https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands_

The prototype was created with a purpose to make deaf and/or numb people communicate easier with other people who don't know the sign language.

Sign language is adapted to Latvian language _(without Ā, Ņ and simillar letters)_.

The list of available signs is available here: ![https://github.com/Wolferado/IevadsStudijuNozare_HandDetection/blob/NewVersionsLandmarks/Images%20for%20Markdown/available_signs.png?raw=true](https://github.com/Wolferado/IevadsStudijuNozare_HandDetection/blob/NewVersionsLandmarks/Images%20for%20Markdown/available_signs.png?raw=true)
